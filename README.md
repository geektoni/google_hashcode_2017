# Google Hashcode 2017

## Introduction

This repository contains one solution to the Online Qualification Round of the
Google Hashcode competition. Here you will find also the pdf file describing
the problem statement, the input files, the output files and a bash script to compile
and run the code automatically on all the dataset.

This solution isn't the best one available (if it was we would have made it to
the final round in Paris ;) ), but it is indeed the most simple solution we were
able to think of. I want to underline that we dealt with an engineering problem,
which means that there is not a general optimal solution.

Our team was called `rational_shadows` and I worked together with my friend
[Edoardo Tessaro](http://github.com/Eralyen). We managed to reach the 723rd
position over 2500 teams with the score of 1964346.
